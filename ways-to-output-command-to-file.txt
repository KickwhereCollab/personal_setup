Overview:

         || visible in terminal ||   visible in file   || existing
 Syntax  ||  StdOut  |  StdErr  ||  StdOut  |  StdErr  ||   file
=========++==========+==========++==========+==========++===========
   >     ||    no    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    || overwrite
   >>    ||    no    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    ||  append
         ||          |          ||          |          ||
  2>     ||   yes    |    no    ||    no    |   yes    || overwrite
  2>>    ||   yes    |    no    ||    no    |   yes    ||  append
         ||          |          ||          |          ||
  &>     ||    no    |    no    ||   yes    |   yes    || overwrite
  &>>    ||    no    |    no    ||   yes    |   yes    ||  append
         ||          |          ||          |          ||
